## üöÄ Key Projects

### [TwoGether - AI Powered Date Planning App](https://github.com/stefandumitresc/TwoGether)
A cross-platform mobile app I'm building from the ground up to provide intelligent, location-aware date recommendations for couples.
* **Frontend**: Built with React Native/Expo, focusing on state management and real-time partner synchronization.
* **Backend (In-Progress)**: Designing a Node.js/Express backend with MinIO and integrating Yelp & Google Places APIs.

### [Minispark - Multi-Threaded Data Processing Framework](https://github.com/stefandumitresc/MiniSpark)
A MapReduce-style framework built in C, inspired by Apache Spark. This project achieved a **6x speedup on 8-core systems** when processing 10GB datasets.
* Implemented a thread pool with work queues to handle over 10,000 tasks with zero deadlocks.
* Used low-level synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables for thread-safe parallel operations.

### [LeNet-5 CNN for Scene Recognition](https://github.com/stefandumitresc/LeNet)
A PyTorch implementation of the classic LeNet-5 architecture built from scratch for scene recognition, as part of CS540 coursework.
* Trained and evaluated on the MiniPlaces dataset (120,000 images, 100 classes), achieving robust classification accuracy.
* Conducted comprehensive hyperparameter analysis to optimize model performance, systematically analyzing the impact of batch size, learning rate, and training duration.
